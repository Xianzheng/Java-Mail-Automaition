This test plan is avaible running under Linux system

fangxianzheng1234@gmail.com as UserName
a334957974 as password to test my code
and This account is already in less security condition

For the part1 of PARTC

It needs to go to the ROOT like.../COMP_348_A4/PartC/part1

javac -classpath .:lib/activation.jar:lib/mail.jar *.java
java -classpath .:lib/activation.jar:lib/mail.jar SendEmail thisfile.txt

The format in thisfile can not change;

Server User Password is already in less secure, so it is best not be changed.

the context of To CC BCC Subject Boday can be changed.

the context of To and CC should be valid.

javac -classpath .:lib/activation.jar:lib/mail.jar *.java
java -classpath .:lib/activation.jar:lib/mail.jar SendEmail thisfile.txt
